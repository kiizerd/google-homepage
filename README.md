Rebuilt the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS

I definitely learned a whole lot about the developer tools and inspector mode on Firefox.
Got very familiar with Flexbox in my many attempts to align the elements and containers the way I wanted them.
I got useful experience in the workflow of designing webpages. Going from the index.html to the style.css and using the live server extension on VS code to see what all of my changes were doing in real time.
I spent way too much time trying to make my website look like a copy of the Google homepage but I think it was really good practice; plus, I had a lot of fun.
There's so many different styles and fancy things you can do to elements it's pretty hard to stop until you find exactly the design you're looking for.
Looking forward to more, and hopefully my page turned out okay.
